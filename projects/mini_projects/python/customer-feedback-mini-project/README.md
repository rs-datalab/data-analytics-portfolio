# Customer Feedback Mini Project (Python For-Loops)

## Overview
This repository contains a beginner-friendly Python mini project built in a Jupyter Notebook.  
It simulates a realistic customer feedback workflow and demonstrates how to use **for-loops**, **conditional logic**, and **nested loops** to summarize and validate simple datasets.

## What’s inside
- **`customer-feedback-mini-project.ipynb`**  
  A self-contained notebook with explanations (Markdown) and Python code.

## Project tasks
1. **Score Categorization**  
   Categorize customer satisfaction scores (1–10) into:
   - Negative (1–5)
   - Neutral (6–8)
   - Positive (9–10)

2. **Verified ID Validation**  
   Compare a list of verified customer IDs against IDs that submitted feedback, and calculate:
   - How many IDs are unverified
   - The percent of feedback that is unverified

3. **$100+ Purchase Check (Nested Loops)**  
   Given purchase histories (list of lists), count how many customers spent **$100+** total.

## Skills demonstrated
- Python fundamentals: variables, lists, functions
- `for` loops
- `if / elif / else`
- Nested loops
- Creating readable outputs
- Writing notebook-style documentation with Markdown

## How to run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the notebook:
   - `customer-feedback-mini-project.ipynb`
3. Run all cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)

## Notes
This project is intentionally beginner-focused and designed to be easy to read and run.  
All test data is generated inside the notebook (no external course files needed).
