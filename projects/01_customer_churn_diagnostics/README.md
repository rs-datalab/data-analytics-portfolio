# NumPy & Pandas Mini-Challenges + Bank Client Capstone

A short, portfolio-focused notebook demonstrating core data analysis skills using **NumPy** and **pandas**.  
It includes a set of mini-challenges (array creation, masking, filtering, aggregation) and a small capstone project that builds and extends a bank client dataset.

## What’s inside
### NumPy mini-challenges
- Create 1D/2D arrays
- Indexing and slicing
- Boolean masking and conditional replacement

### Pandas mini-challenges
- Build a simple stock portfolio DataFrame and compute total value
- Filter and aggregate client data
- Apply custom functions to transform columns
- Read tabular data from HTML using `pd.read_html`

### Capstone: Bank client dataset
- Create two client tables (IDs 1–5 and 6–10)
- Manually add **Annual Salary** for each client
- Concatenate into a single dataset
- Add a new client (ID 11)
- Run quick validation checks (shape, missing values, summary stats)

## Files
- `[your_notebook_name].ipynb` — the notebook with challenges + capstone

## How to run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas lxml
```

3. Open the notebook and run all cells

> Note: Some websites may block automated HTML table reads. If `pd.read_html` fails with a 403, it’s typically a site policy, not an issue with pandas.


## Skills demonstrated

* Python (NumPy, pandas)
* DataFrame construction and manipulation
* Cleaning / filtering with boolean logic
* Aggregations and basic analysis
* Working with external tabular data (HTML tables)
